This project analyzes a fictional e-commerce transactions dataset to extract business insights using PostgreSQL. The analysis focuses on customer behavior, product performance, revenue metrics, discount analysis, and ranking within categories.

Key SQL concepts demonstrated include:

Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX)

Grouping and filtering with GROUP BY and HAVING

Subqueries for order-level analysis

Window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK)

Date-based analysis and monthly trends

Business logic filtering (completed vs cancelled orders)

The project is structured to reflect real-world analytics tasks commonly performed by data analysts and business intelligence professionals.
